# acorn

A **local macOS agent workspace** for GitHub. acorn began as a keyboard-driven pull-request reviewer
and has grown into a workspace for driving coding agents (Claude Code, Codex, aider) against your
repositories — each task in its own git worktree, with the PR, diff, terminal, editor, notes, and the
agent all in one window.

It is a **SolidJS SPA** served by an in-process **Hono server** (`@hono/node-server`) running in the
Electron main process, backed by a **local SQLite** read-model mirror of GitHub data (better-sqlite3 +
Drizzle), an **on-disk** blob cache for diff/patch bodies, and **IndexedDB** client persistence. Log in
with GitHub and you get:

- **PR review** — searchable repo picker with pins, virtualized PR lists, and a rich detail view with
  Shiki-highlighted diffs (unified/split, word-level intra-line, inline review-comment threads,
  per-file "viewed" tracking) and write actions (merge, close, reopen, draft/ready, comment, review,
  labels, reviewers, re-run Actions).
- **Workspaces & tasks** — group your repos into workspaces; open a task (repo + branch + worktree +
  optional PR) from a PR, a Linear ticket, a Rollbar error, or from scratch. Tasks live in a left rail.
- **Panes** — a task view composes panes side by side: PR review, local-changes review, editor, notes,
  context, browser preview, Linear, and Rollbar.
- **Terminals & agents** *(behind a flag)* — persistent shell/agent sessions in the task's worktree, an
  Agents panel with a live activity feed, and an MCP server that hands agents the task's context.

The Electron main process starts the Hono server on `http://127.0.0.1:4317` and points a hardened
`BrowserWindow` at it, so the SPA and API are same-origin:

- `/api/*` and `/auth/*` are handled by the server; all other paths serve the SPA shell `index.html`.
- acorn was originally a Cloudflare Worker; the migration to Electron is documented in
  [docs/electron.md](./docs/electron.md).

## Tech stack

- **Frontend:** SolidJS + `@solidjs/router`, TanStack Query (with async-storage persist),
  TanStack Virtual, Shiki for syntax highlighting, `diff` / `gitdiff-parser` for diff parsing, Monaco
  for the editor pane, xterm for terminals.
- **Backend:** Hono on `@hono/node-server` in the Electron main process; `jose` for the
  encrypted-cookie session and at-rest secret encryption; node-pty + tmux for terminal sessions.
- **Data:** local SQLite (`better-sqlite3`) via Drizzle ORM; on-disk dir for blob/patch caching;
  IndexedDB (`idb-keyval`) for client-side query persistence. All under `apps/desktop/.acorn/`.
- **Agents:** the acorn MCP server (`@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`) exposes task context to agent CLIs.
- **Build / tooling:** electron-vite (main/preload/renderer), electron-builder (macOS packaging),
  drizzle-kit, Vitest, TypeScript (strict). pnpm workspace + Turborepo monorepo.

## Monorepo layout

pnpm workspace + Turborepo. All app code lives in `apps/desktop` (`@acorn/desktop`).

## Local setup (condensed)

Full step-by-step (OAuth App creation, gotchas, scripts) is in
[docs/local-development.md](./docs/local-development.md).

Prerequisites: Node ≥ 20, pnpm 11 (`corepack enable`), and a GitHub OAuth App whose
**Authorization callback URL** is `http://127.0.0.1:4317/auth/callback` (the `127.0.0.1` form,
not `localhost`).

```bash
# 1. Secrets — create apps/desktop/.env with:
#    GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=...
#    GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=...
#    SESSION_ENC_KEY=...   (exactly 64 hex chars)
openssl rand -hex 32

# 2. Install
pnpm install

# 3. Build better-sqlite3 for Electron's ABI (once; see ABI note below)
pnpm --filter @acorn/desktop electron:rebuild

# 4. Build + launch the Electron app
pnpm dev
```

The window opens on `http://127.0.0.1:4317`; log in with GitHub. Migrations apply automatically on
startup. The terminal/agents surface is desktop-only and behind a flag — enable it in DevTools with
`localStorage.setItem('acorn:term','1')` then reload.

> **better-sqlite3 ABI:** the native module builds for one ABI at a time. `pnpm dev` (Electron) needs
> the Electron ABI (`electron:rebuild`); `dev:node` / `db:migrate` (plain Node) need the Node ABI
> (`node:rebuild`).

### Common scripts

| Script | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `pnpm dev` | Build + launch the Electron app (`electron-vite build && electron-vite preview`) |
| `pnpm --filter @acorn/desktop dev:node` | Run just the Node server (no Electron) on `:4317` |
| `pnpm --filter @acorn/desktop build` | `electron-vite build` (main + preload + renderer) |
| `pnpm --filter @acorn/desktop dist` | `electron-vite build && electron-builder --mac` — produce the `.dmg`/`.zip` |
| `pnpm lint` | `tsc --noEmit` typecheck |
| `pnpm test` | `vitest run` |
| `pnpm --filter @acorn/desktop db:generate` | `drizzle-kit generate` — emit a migration |
| `pnpm --filter @acorn/desktop db:migrate` | `tsx scripts/migrate.ts` — apply migrations to local SQLite |

## Packaging (macOS)

```bash
pnpm --filter @acorn/desktop dist   # → apps/desktop/release/*.dmg and *.zip
```

For personal use the build is ad-hoc signed. To distribute the `.dmg` to other machines, add a
Developer ID identity + notarization in `apps/desktop/electron-builder.yml` (otherwise Gatekeeper
blocks it). Secrets are read from `apps/desktop/.env` in dev; packaged builds will read from the OS
keychain (planned — see [docs/electron.md](./docs/electron.md)). Since a GitHub OAuth App allows only
one callback URL, use a dedicated OAuth App for the desktop build.
