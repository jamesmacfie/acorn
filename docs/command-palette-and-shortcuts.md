# Command palette and shortcuts

Keyboard commands are registered by the shell and feature contributions. `CommandPalette.tsx`
combines static actions, plugin palette rows, task/workspace rows, and Node-aware aggregate results.
It imports no feature implementation.

## Global commands

| Shortcut | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `⌘K` | Open command palette |
| `⌘P` | Open worktree file finder |
| `⌘L` | Open workspace switcher |
| `⌘⇧N` | Create a local task |
| `⌘⇧T` | Toggle terminal drawer |
| `⌘1`–`⌘9` | Activate the corresponding visible task |
| `⌘,` | Open Settings |
| `Escape` | Close the topmost overlay or cancel the current action |

The exact platform modifier is handled by the keyboard layer. Inputs, editors, terminals, and
contenteditable elements stop global commands unless a command explicitly opts into text handling.

## Palette data

Palette rows can be static or task/Node-backed. Fleet rows carry a Node label and tolerate partial
availability. A row action targets the Node that owns its resource; no aggregate action pretends to
be cross-Node atomic.

Run targets and workflow rows are contributed from the Node's task configuration. Pane and source
commands are registered by their owning plugin. User-configured shortcuts are applied after defaults;
conflicts are reported and never silently steal an existing binding.

## Pane shortcuts

The shipped pane chords are contribution-owned and tested with the pane registry. Settings →
Shortcuts can override or unbind them. Persisted pane IDs remain stable because they are layout data.

## Focus and typing

The global key handler checks editable targets, terminal focus, composition state, modifier intent,
and open overlays. The terminal drawer and main task surface have separate focus restoration so a
palette close returns focus to the action that opened it.
